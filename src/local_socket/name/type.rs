//! Construction of local socket names, facilitating local socket implementation dispatch.
//!
//! The traits [`PathNameType`] and [`NamespacedNameType`] are implemented on uninhabited tag types
//! and are to be used via [`ToFsName`](super::ToFsName) and [`ToNsName`](super::ToNsName)
//! respectively. They are also sealed (cannot be implemented outside of Interprocess).
//!
//! The name type you choose affects what local socket implementation will be used. See the
//! documentation on the tag types to learn more.
