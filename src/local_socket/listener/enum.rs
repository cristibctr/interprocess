/// # Name reclamation
/// *This section only applies to Unix domain sockets.*
///
/// When a Unix domain socket listener is closed, its associated socket file is not automatically
/// deleted. Instead, it remains on the filesystem in a zombie state, neither accepting connections
/// nor allowing a new listener to reuse it â€“ [`create_sync()`] will return
/// [`AddrInUse`](io::ErrorKind::AddrInUse) unless it is deleted manually.
///
/// Interprocess implements *automatic name reclamation* via: when the local socket listener is
/// dropped, it performs [`std::fs::remove_file()`] (i.e. `unlink()`) with the path that was
/// originally passed to [`create_sync()`], allowing for subsequent reuse of the local socket name.
///
/// If the program crashes in a way that doesn't unwind the stack, the deletion will not occur and
/// the socket file will linger on the filesystem, in which case manual deletion will be necessary.
/// Identially, the automatic name reclamation mechanism can be opted out of via
/// [`.do_not_reclaim_name_on_drop()`](trait::Listener::do_not_reclaim_name_on_drop) on the listener
/// or [`.reclaim_name(false)`](super::options::ListenerOptions::reclaim_name) on the builder.
///
/// Note that the socket file can be unlinked by other programs at any time, retaining the inode the
/// listener is bound to but making it inaccessible to peers if it was at its last hardlink. If that
/// happens and another listener takes the same path before the first one performs name reclamation,
/// the socket file deletion wouldn't correspond to the listener being closed, instead deleting the
/// socket file of the second listener. If the second listener also performs name reclamation, the
/// ensuing deletion will silently fail. Due to the awful design of Unix, this issue cannot be
/// mitigated.
